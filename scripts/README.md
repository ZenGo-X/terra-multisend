# Terra Mulitsender Deployer

This is a basic script that uses `Terra.js` to deploy the multisender smart contract.
The scripts uses the hardcoded mnemonics of the [LocalTerra](https://github.com/terra-project/LocalTerra) network.

The scripts performs the following tasks:

1. Upload the compiled byte code to the blockchain
2. Instantiate a new contract and print its contract address

Contract initialization receives a fee parameter. The fee is payed to the contract owner upon interaction with the contract. The fee can be initiated to 0.

In order to upload to tequila-0004:

- Change the endpoint of the node in the code when creating the LCD
- Change the mnemonic to one you have funds on tequila-0004
- Change the name of the contract being uploaded in necessary

This is a template script that can be easily adapted to other smart contrats, as well as test functionality.

## Installation

```sh
yarn install
yarn build
```

Built files will be located in the `dist` folder.

## Running the Code

```
node ./dist/src/index.js
```

If all is correct, the script prints the address of your new contract
